<h1>Sudoku</h1>
<h2>Makers Academy Project - Week 4</h2>

Our project for this week was to create a Sudoku solver. 

The task was set by our teacher <a href= "http://www.github.com/ecomba">@ecomba</a>.

It currently only works for very simple puzzles.

It iterates over the grid row by row till it has been solved or it breaks if the puzzle is not solvable by this method.
